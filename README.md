## 3/26/21

This application is able to generate a random password based on characters approved by the user. Upon pressing the "Generate Password" button, the user is first prompted to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. If this criteria is not met, the display area will say "Please try again" and the user will need to start the process again.

Once the password length has been established, the user will see a series of confirmation messages which give them the option to add different types of characters to their password. If no character types are chosen, the display area will say "Please try again" and the user will need to start the process again.

When the length of the password and the character types have been confirmed, the new password will appear in the text area.
